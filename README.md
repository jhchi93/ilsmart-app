# ilsmart-app

This repository contains the code of a Java application called ILS Data Accumulator on which I have worked on during my internship period at Fokker Sevices, an Aerospace Service Provider in Hoofddorp in the Netherlands. The main purpose of this application is to retrieve data from an online marketplace known as ILSmart.
